            p With four modules forming its core parts, the Infinity is infinitely expandable and obsolete-proof. You can replace or upgrade modules individually at a fraction of the cost of the entire device.
            p You can also create a module tailored to your needs by connecting a Raspberry Pi or Chromebit to the Infinity through the USB-C ports.
            p The Infinity is both a tablet and a laptop combined. Detach the screen, and start interacting with the tablet. With a built-in accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope, you can use the Infinity in a variety of classroom exercises.

              span An enterprise level device in a kid-friendly package. We have designed a computer a 4-year-old can assemble and use. A resilient casing protects the modules from damage, and a unique filleted keyboard prevents keys from being removed. With a modular design, the Infinity can grow in power &#38; functionality alongside the child's personal development.

            p The Infinity is a full fledged educational device minus the hassle. The Infinity's Android core module is simple enough that children under 10 can independently use them. But a child in her last year of primary school could benefit hugely by simply plugging in a Linux or Windows supporting module. The Infinity is robust enough to survive the classroom and the playground.
            p That's why we went for modularity - allowing children, schools and communities to change the computer to meet their requirements - not the other way around.

              span A child born today without access to technology in their formative years risks missing out on social and economic opportunities later in life. Over an entire childhood, the cost of adopting technology and keeping it up to date is so high, that it prohibits ubiquitous access to technology, and creates a digital divide.
